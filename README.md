# Blackjack Project
Mini blackjack simulator made to demonstrate DOM manupulation
## The game can be played here:

## Assignment 
This purpose of this project was to practice using DOM manipulation by creating either a memory baseed card game or a blackjack simulator. I chose to create a Blackjack game

## Overview
The program creates 5 decks of 52 cards and then proceeds to shuffle them into a single larger deck. From there whenever cards are dealt, they are popped from the deck and inserted into the player/dealer's hand. From that point I implemented basic blackjack rules making the dealer hit on anything below a 17 and making sure the player/dealer bust whenever going over 21.

## Challenge
The hardest part of this project was figuring out how to change 'Aces' in a players hand from 11 to 1 whenever the would usually bust and making sure the visuals matched up with the value of their hand.
